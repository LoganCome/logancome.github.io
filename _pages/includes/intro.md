I am a third-year PhD candidate at the Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. I was supervised by IEEE Fellow [Prof. Jun Zhang](https://eejzhang.people.ust.hk/).

Prior to this, I obtained my Bachelor's degree from Hainan University with the best graduation honor of "Student of the Year Awards", while was supervised by [Prof. Jieren Cheng](https://hd.hainanu.edu.cn/cs/info/1104/1857.htm). I then earned my MPhil degree at the [Cloud Computing Center](http://cloud.siat.ac.cn/cloud/) of [SIAT](https://www.siat.ac.cn/), [Chinese Academy of Science](https://www.cas.cn/), and later at the [SKL-IOTSC](https://skliotsc.um.edu.mo/), where I was supervised by IEEE Fellow [Prof. Cheng-Zhong Xu](https://www.fst.um.edu.mo/personal/czxu/). Following that, I joined HKUST for my Ph.D. studies and completed my coursework at the Robotics Institute during the first two years.
