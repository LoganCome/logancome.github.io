I am a third-year PhD candidate at the Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. I was supervised by IEEE Fellow [Prof. Jun Zhang](https://eejzhang.people.ust.hk/).

Prior to this, I obtained my Bachelor's degree from Hainan University with the best graduation honor of "Student of the Year", while was supervised by [Prof. Jieren Cheng](https://hd.hainanu.edu.cn/cs/info/1104/1857.htm). I then earned my MPhil degree at the [Cloud Computing Center](http://cloud.siat.ac.cn/cloud/) of [SIAT](https://www.siat.ac.cn/), [Chinese Academy of Science](https://www.cas.cn/), and later at the [SKL-IOTSC](https://skliotsc.um.edu.mo/), where I was supervised by IEEE Fellow [Prof. Cheng-Zhong Xu](https://www.fst.um.edu.mo/personal/czxu/). Following that, I joined HKUST for my Ph.D. studies and completed my coursework at the Robotics Institute with [Prof. Ming Liu](https://facultyprofiles.hkust.edu.hk/profiles.php?profile=ming-liu-eelium#researchinterest) and [Prof. Lujia Wang](https://facultyprofiles.hkust.edu.hk/profiles.php?profile=lujia-wang-eewanglj) during the first two years.

My research interest includes robotics and federated learning. Papers were accepted by [leading robotics conferences/journals](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=top_venues&hl=zh-CN&vq=eng_robotics) as TASE, RAL, ICRA, IROS, IJCNN, etc. I was the winner of Outstanding Paper Award of [CCF](https://www.ccf.org.cn/en/) National Conference of Theoretical Computer Science in 2017.

I attempted to commercialize my research and established Hainan Data-Vigor Technology Co.LTD, which is now a National High-tech S/M Enterprise. And also a co-founder of Hainan H.R.Z.C. Technology Co.LTD, which is now a National High-tech Enterprise. Two years ago, I returned to full-time research to pursue my Ph.D.

During my university years, I volunteered to provide educational support to underprivileged areas (贫困山区支教) and established the IEEE HNU Student Branch and the Robotics Association. As the founding chairman, I worked to promote awareness and education in robotics and AI, making a difference for students from educationally disadvantaged regions. As a result of these, I was honored with the Educational Achievement Award from the government.
